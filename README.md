# FocusingNeuron
Repo for focusing neuron (adaptive locally connected neuron)

Depends on other libraries: numpy, scikit, theano, lasagne


Quick example:
python Test-Synthetic-Inputs.py

- Real example
python mnist.py focused_mlp:2,800,0.25,0.25 10 1 mnist mnist10 0.0


DATA 
# requires mnist.npz or downloads it from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

# Other datasets such as cifar_10 and fashion can be downloaded with keras

# mnist_cluttered data is difficult to find in internet
